I felt able to sleep much more deeply than\r\n        I had in ages. It affected me so much that I hatched a plan. I started studying and\r\n        practicing after I had my second baby, qualified with a Level 3 Diploma in Reflexology\r\n        from Brighton Holistics and became a member of the Association of Reflexologists. I have\r\n        also become a member of the Complementary &amp; Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC) which means that\r\n        if you have a private healthcare plan, you should be able to claim for the cost of the treatment.</p>\r\n      <p>I live in Horsham with my husband, two young boys and fur baby.

This is why it needs addressing if it is becoming a problem.</p>\r\n      <p>I found it fairly easy to jot down a list of tips to help with sleeplessness.

Then when pregnant, it got worse - I would go for longer spells of just not sleeping at all, which I know is common (due to hormonal changes and not being able to get comfortable). I struggle to sleep when I go away, which means holidays aren’t always as relaxing as they should be. Now I have two young boys who often have me up at night - but I manage to get back to sleep fairly easily so it isn’t too much of a problem (most of the time). I hope if you are suffering, some of these tips will be of help to you:</p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li><strong>Dark:</strong> make your room nice and dark with blackout blinds or even easier, sleep with an eye mask.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Bath:</strong> a lovely magnesium salt bath before bed can help to relax your muscles.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Apps:</strong> apps such as Headspace or Calm have sleep stories that can help your mind switch off, and normally incorporate some breathing exercises to release tension.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Snack:</strong> bananas and figs are great for promoting sleep as they contain the natural muscle relaxants magnesium and potassium and can be made into a smoothie for an evening snack.  Avoid spicy or very large meals before bedtime as digestion can distract from falling asleep.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Avoid liquid:</strong> avoid too much liquid so that you are not distrubed by toilet visits.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Active:</strong> be active and get plenty of fresh air during the day, but stop working/ exercising/ doing at least an hour before bed time so that your body and mind have time to wind down.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Weighted blanket:</strong> this can be very beneficial if you have anxiety or insomnia, the pressure is calming and it feels like you are getting a big hug.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Routine:</strong> try to have a regular bedtime and waking time so that your body and mind grow to expect it.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Avoid screen time:</strong> try to stop screen time at least half an hour before bedtime as the blue light can trick your body into thinking it’s daytime, and also it makes you alert when you are meant to be getting sleepy.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Avoid alcohol:</strong> while you may fall asleep more quickly, it’s not the beneficial REM sleep and more frequent toilet visits mean it’s more difficult to stay asleep.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Stop trying:</strong> it sounds strange but if you haven’t been able to get to sleep for a while, then stop trying.  Sometimes it can get quite stressful if you are fixating on the fact that you are not sleeping, I would panic thinking I hadn’t slept yet and I had to get up in X number of hours.  Give into it and get up, do something different - maybe something calming to take your mind off it like reading a book.  After a while you are likely to start feeling sleepier so you can go back to bed and give it another go.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Change of scene:</strong> sometimes beds just don’t work.  I try all sorts of positions in mine, upside down, diagonal (my poor husband)!  And sometimes I resort to our cheap Ikea sofa bed which works a treat!  I don’t know what it is, but it just seems to work for me.  So if you need to, do consider a change of scene.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Brain dump:</strong> if you have lists of things to remember running through your mind, or you feel overwhelmed by what you have on the following day, then get up and write a list of what it is that you need to remember so that your mind can relax.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Avoid caffeine:</strong> stop drinking caffeine after lunch, it’s surprising what an effect this can have.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Reflexology:</strong> I never sleep as deeply as after a reflexology treatment (and for a few days after).  Glow reflexology offers evening appointments in the comfort of your own home.  I often treat people who have had a bath and are in their pyjamas ready to get an early night after their treatment.</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n      <p>It's worth saying that while these tips have all helped me at one time or another, if there is something major in your life that is causing the sleeplessness (an insane job, worry about your relationship, health etc.) then taking steps to address the underlying problem will eventually help more than anything else.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nimport sleepImg from '../assets/images/sleep.jpg';\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  data () {\r\n    return {}\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style scoped lang=\"less\">\r\n@import '../assets/css/less/responsive.less';\r\n\r\n.content {\r\n  > .subtitle {\r\n    grid-column: 2/8;\r\n    grid-row: 1/2;\r\n    .screen-xs-max({\r\n      grid-column: 1/9;\r\n    });\r\n    > h1 {\r\n      margin: 0;\r\n    }\r\n    > p {\r\n      margin-bottom: 0;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  > .title {\r\n    grid-column: 2/8;\r\n    grid-row: 2/3;\r\n    .screen-xs-max({\r\n      grid-column: 1/9;\r\n      grid-row: 3/4;\r\n    });\r\n    > h2 {\r\n      font-size: 2.2em;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  > h3 {\r\n    grid-column: 2/5;\r\n    grid-row: 3/4;\r\n    margin: 0;\r\n    .screen-xs-max({\r\n      grid-column: 1/9;\r\n      grid-row: 4/5;\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n  > .image {\r\n    grid-row: 3/5;\r\n    object-position: left bottom;\r\n    .screen-xs-max({\r\n      grid-row: 2/3;\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n  > .body-copy {\r\n    grid-column: 2/5;\r\n    grid-row: 4/5;\r\n    .screen-xs-max({\r\n      grid-column: 1/9;\r\n      grid-row: 5/6;\r\n    });\r\n    > ul {\r\n      padding-left: 20px;\r\n      margin: 20px 0;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</style>\r\n","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./how-to-get-more-sleep.vue?vue&type=template&id=5c2d6cb8&scoped=true&\"\nimport script from \"./how-to-get-more-sleep.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./how-to-get-more-sleep.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nimport style0 from \"./how-to-get-more-sleep.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=5c2d6cb8&scoped=true&lang=less&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  \"5c2d6cb8\",\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _vm._m(0)}\nvar staticRenderFns = [function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"content\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"subtitle\"},[_c('h1',[_vm._v(\"blog\")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"10th of November 2019\")])]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('div',{staticClass:\"title\"},[_c('h2',[_vm._v(\"how to...get more sleep\")])]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('h3',[_vm._v(\"We all know that a lack of sleep can make our days much harder than they would otherwise be.\")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('img',{staticClass:\"image\",attrs:{\"src\":\"/src/assets/images/sleep.jpg\",\"alt\":\"Tired person sleeping on the sofa\"}}),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('div',{staticClass:\"body-copy\"},[_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Personally, I get clumsy, tearful and snappy so it affects the poor people I share my life with too.

But in the past I have taken it to the extreme. I've done it all:</p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>In my twenties I spent ALL my money on partying and presents so I tried to live off the office supply of mince pies - for a whole week. Needless to say I felt awful and put on a stone that year</li>\r\n        <li>I am known for taking it too far at work Christmas parties because: free bar. I then spend the rest of the Christmas period in a spiral of shame about the things I have done. It's probably for the best that I now work in a team of one</li>\r\n        <li>I've fallen asleep before the Christmas lunch</li>\r\n        <li>I've not made it out on New Year's Eve because I peaked too soon the night before</li>\r\n        <li>When pregnant I cried because I couldn't fit the potatoes in the oven. I wanted to cancel Christmas</li>\r\n        <li>This list could go on and on...</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n      <p>But seriously, Christmas can be really stressful. The financial and social pressure can take its toll, not to mention the physical impact of all the lovely food and drink. Also if you are feeling lonely or that you are not quite living up to the image of the perfect family portrayed so heavily in the media at this time, these feelings can be really exacerbated at Christmas.</p>\r\n      <p>Reflecting on this led me to thinking about coping mechanisms for getting through the festive period in one piece. I'm not convinced I will make it through the festive period in one piece, and I may have to refer back to this list a lot. But regardless, here are my top tips:</p>\r\n      <ol>\r\n        <li><strong>Create boundaries when it comes to spending</strong> on presents. It's good to agree budgets with family members or better yet, give favours instead or no presents at all. I am so lucky that my husbands' family have agreed to no presents</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Small children don't need you to spend much on them</strong>. My two year old is going to be over the moon with his second hand Little Tikes Car and charity shop goodies.

This is at a time when a new mum needs support the most. Becoming a mum for the first time is a shock to the system no matter how prepared you are. You are expected to learn how to look after a tiny little human while surviving on no sleep with almost always some element of physical recovery. There is also the pressure to breastfeed and stress over whether it is working or not, and the changes to your body due to this. This is not to mention the huge fluctuations in hormones at this time, which go on for months before settling down.  It also feels like there is so much to be anxious about when caring for tiny ones! I strongly believe more should be done to encourage new mums to take time to recover. It’s something that used to happen more but in our current society, doesn’t seem to be emphasised enough.</p>\r\n      <p>This is where reflexology can be hugely beneficial.

Clients also report that reflexology can help to re-balance hormones, boost their immune system and help to regulate sleep patterns that might have gone awry. Another huge benefit of reflexology over other therapies is that new mums don’t have to expose their recovering bodies - just their feet and lower legs.</li></p>\r\n      <p>There are also more practical benefits to mobile reflexology treatments:</p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>Seeing clients in their own home means there is no need to disturb a sleeping baby to travel, and no stress about packing everything required.</li>\r\n        <li>I bring a reclining chair and everything else required for a treatment. This type of chair enables comfortable breastfeeding or cuddling of little babies during the treatment.  But reflexology can be delivered pretty much anywhere, so if you are more comfortable in bed or on the sofa, this is no problem at all.</li>\r\n        <li>From experience, babies often stay asleep during the treatments as they enjoy the relaxing music and ambience created - but if they don’t, then it’s fine to pause the treatment while you make a bottle, change a nappy, whatever is needed.</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n      <p>Taking regular time out like this will encourage both physical and emotional healing, hopefully helping to lower chances of postnatal depression or burnout developing.
