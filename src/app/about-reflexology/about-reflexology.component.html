  <h2>about reflexology</h2>
</div>
<h3>The ancient practice of foot reflexology was developed from the premise that there are over 7,000 reflex points in the feet that can be mapped to different parts of your body.</h3>

  <p>Applying pressure to these reflexes is deeply relaxing which in turn can provide the optimal state for your body to heal.</p>
  <p>Reflexologists treat people as a whole rather than specific conditions/symptoms. We support people living with illnesses, rather than treat their illnesses.</p>
  <p>Too much stress and tension over a prolonged period of time can have such a detrimental effect on your health and wellbeing.  Reflexology is fantastic at promoting :</p>
  <ul class="bold">
    <li>Relaxation</li>
    <li>Release of tension</li>
    <li>Improved sleep</li>
    <li>Improved mood</li>
    <li>Increased wellbeing</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Reflexology is a complementary therapy and is recognised by the NHS, many GPs and hospices.  While reflexology works very well alongside conventional medicine, it should never be used in place of seeking professional medical advice. If you are concerned about your health, always consult your GP first.</p>
