<div class="body-copy">
  <p>After years spent working in London and Melbourne in jobs that often left me feeling frazzled and unable to sleep, and turning to reflexology in my first pregnancy - I was overwhelmed by the effect it had on me.  I felt able to sleep much more deeply than I had in ages.  It affected me so much that I hatched a plan.  I started studying and practicing after I had my second baby, qualified with a Level 3 Diploma in Reflexology from Brighton Holistics and became a member of the Federation of Holistic Therapists.</p>
  <p>I live in Horsham with my two young boys and fur baby Meggy.  These guys have taught me the importance of self-care - you canâ€™t pour from an empty cup as they say!  I am married to an Aussie, and we are normally planning our next big (or little) trip.  I love a festival, beach, music, yoga and running and generally being in nature as much as possible.</p>
