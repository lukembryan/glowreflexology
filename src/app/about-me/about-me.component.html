  <h2>about me</h2>
</div>
<div class="body-copy">
  <p>After years spent working in London and Melbourne in jobs that often left me
    feeling frazzled and unable to sleep, and turning to reflexology in my first pregnancy -
    I was overwhelmed by the effect it had on me.  I felt able to sleep much more deeply than
    I had in ages.  It affected me so much that I hatched a plan.  I started studying and
    practicing after I had my second baby, qualified with a Level 3 Diploma in Reflexology
    from Brighton Holistics and became a member of the Federation of Holistic Therapists and
    Association of Reflexologists. I have also become a member of the Complementary &amp;
    Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC) which means that if you have a private healthcare plan,
    you should be able to claim for the cost of the treatment.</p>
  <p>I live in Horsham with my two young boys and fur baby. These guys have taught me the importance of self-care - you canâ€™t pour from an empty cup!  I am married to an Aussie, and we are normally planning our next big (or little) trip.  I love a festival, beach, music, yoga and running. Being in nature makes me happy.</p>
