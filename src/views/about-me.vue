    <div class="body-copy">
      <p>After years spent working in London and Melbourne in jobs that often left me
        feeling frazzled and unable to sleep, and turning to reflexology in my first pregnancy -
        I was overwhelmed by the effect it had on me. I felt able to sleep much more deeply than
        I had in ages. It affected me so much that I hatched a plan. I started studying and
        practicing after I had my second baby, qualified with a Level 3 Diploma in Reflexology
        from Brighton Holistics and became a member of the Federation of Holistic Therapists and
        Association of Reflexologists. I have also become a member of the Complementary &amp;
        Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC) which means that if you have a private healthcare plan,
        you should be able to claim for the cost of the treatment.</p>
      <p>I live in Horsham with my husband, two young boys and fur baby. These guys have taught me the importance of self-care - you canâ€™t pour from an empty cup!  I am married to an Aussie, and we are normally planning our next big (or little) trip.  I love a festival, beach, music, yoga and running. Being in nature makes me happy.</p>
