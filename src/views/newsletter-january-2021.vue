      <p>It's been so long since I have sent a newsletter. Obviously it's been an insane year with a lot of stop-starting and trying to keep on top of Government guidelines - communication has fallen by the wayside! I hope you are all keeping safe and as well as possible.</p>
      <p>It's been very uncertain times for everyone, and self-employed therapists like myself have at times not known whether they were coming or going. I really didn't know what to expect after the first lockdown, but reassuringly I was busier than ever. People are recognising the importance of self-care at a time when they are working under difficult conditions and facing high levels of anxiety. I feel hopeful that there will be a strong place for reflexology once restrictions are lifted.</p>
      <p>For me, 2020 wasnâ€™t all bad!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I undertook further study in the incredible Reprofexology course, during which I learnt about the reproductive system in depth, fertility and assisted conception. I can now undertake specific protocols targeted at different complaints, to help regulate cycles, and to stimulate, balance or sedate different hormones for both men and women. A huge amount of work went into this and I am eagerly waiting to hear whether I passed - please keep your fingers crossed!</li>
        <li>During the first lockdown I managed to take my offering online - explaining hand reflexology techniques via video call. I hope to do this with those in need during this current lockdown too.</li>
        <li>I started work with Surrey Hills Physiotherapy at the beautiful Barn at Denbies Wine Estate.</li>
        <li>I moved house and started work on converting my summer house into a treatment room so that I can provide a bit more luxury (I will still offer mobile treatments).  I am trying to source as much as possible second hand so as to be as eco as I can, as well as bearing in mind Covid hygiene measures.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I am sure you have been inundated with self-care tips, so I will try and keep these short and unique! These are just a few things that have been helping me through these winter months:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Working this reflex point can help to relax and to improve sleep. I have marked a point on this hand which is very powerful - the Solar Plexus reflex. Use your thumb to put pressure on this point and rotate around 6 times, on both hands. You will find the more you do it, the more calming it is, it has a cumulative effect.</li>
        <li>I have discovered Yin or Restorative Yoga. I have stopped punishing myself with weights or running as a default. Life is hard enough at the moment. Sometimes you just need to give your body a treat, and this style of yoga does just that. Yoga with Adriene is so good, free, and on YouTube (see <a href="https://youtu.be/RQyX48NtDrQ" target="_blank">here</a>). It's definitely worth a try.</li>
        <li>Vitamin D is so hard to come by naturally at this time of year so it's important to take a supplement - it can really boost your immunity. I recommend a high quality brand such as Solgar or Lamberts.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Sadly I am not open for business just now but as soon as I am able I will update my social media and website. As a thank you for making it to the end of my newsletter I will be offering 10% off for one treatment if you mention the special code "and breathe".</p>
      <p>Stay safe friends, I hope to see you soon.</p>
      <p>Love, Emily x</p>
